Advanced Virgo+ will enhance its sensitivity for the upcoming run, O4. This means that Newtonian noise might dominate in the low-frequency band. 
For this reason, it is critical working to reduce it as well. This will be achieved through active noise cancellation. It is of fundamental importance to 
understand how to optimally deploy an array of seismic sensors dedicated to active noise cancellation. This talk will present a new technique that allows 
us to use existent seismic data to construct a surrogate Wiener filter model bypassing all the difficulties related to the computational effort required 
by the task.
